Should be a relatively long post, in which you summarize the performance based on sub-asset class (buyout, VC), geography (US/Europe), performance measure (Multiple, IRR, PME), different statistics (median, mean, pooled), data sources, etc. Also include J-curves.

In addition, explain some subtle issues, such as the right-skewed distribution. Also, compare with other studies.
