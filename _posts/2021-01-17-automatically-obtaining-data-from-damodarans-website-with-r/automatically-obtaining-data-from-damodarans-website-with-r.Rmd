NYU professor Aswath Damodaran has very helpful data about many important financial market topics such as discount rates, valuation multiples, etc. on his [website](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/dataarchived.html). However, the data is saved in Excel files that do not necessarily have a standardized format to easily obtain the information automatically.
